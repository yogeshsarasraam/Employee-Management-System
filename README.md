# Employee-Management-System

Hi,
This is an Employee Management System developed using Java and PostrgreSQL. This system comes with login and register options to create new user. The level of users are a main admin, admin and other ordinary users. The admin can make others admin and only the main admin can remove others from admin to normal users. The operation it allows are 
  Creating a new employee detail,
  Update an existing employee detail,
  Delete an employee detail,
  Adding new columns to the database,
  Deleting existing columns,
  List all employee details,
  Searching based on several methods for employee details based on any columns,
  Sorting on ascending and descending order based on any column,
  Making others admin,
  Romoving others from admin
for main admin.

The ordinary admin can have access to above stated all except making others and removing others from admin.
The normal users can have access only to viewing employee detials i.e. list of all employees, searching and sorting.

This is the main overview of the system and it would be helpful in place where an efficient employee management system is needed.

Thank you,
